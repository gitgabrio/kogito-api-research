KOGITO-API-RESEARCH
===================

This project features the Kafka messaging environment as managed by the [Confluent Platform](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/quickstart/ce-docker-quickstart.html). Look at the link for further information.

Main idea behind this implementation is to have a distributed/scalable system of model-executing instances.
See [original plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUTi4c2w_oASgU_kaxUDYdLfpAbN3DyQ05gFvomh-Ss/) for details

The grossly defined picture should be 

![Overall design](./OverallDesign.png)

For each model definition there is a ModelExecutor.
ModelServer are Model-specific "gateway", i.e. each of them handle specific Model-type, and each of them "knows" a set of actual model definitions.
Every ModelServer has a List of "registered" Model executors.
ModelServer are responsible to listen from requests and activate the required model-executor if it is registered to itself, ignore otherwise.
It does not matter where such ModelServers are deployed, nor if the same model-executor is registered to multiple ModelServers: request will be managed only by the first answering ModelServer.

Every request coming from any Rest endpoint is routed to a shared message bus.
All ModelServers listen to the bus, then

1) if the request is for a different model type, the ModelServer ignores it
2) if the request is for the same model type, but the actual model is unknown, the ModelServer reply with a "Model not found" message
3) if the request is for the same model type, and the actual model is registered with the ModelServer, the ModelServer:
   a) reply with a "Model found" message
   b) "activate" the specific model executor
4) if no "Model found" message is received, then the Rest endpoint will return a failed execution notification
5) if a "Model found" message is received, then the Rest endpoint will wait and return (asynchronously) the evaluated result

Model executor activation means:
    1) tell the model executor to register to the bus
    2) forward the request data to the model executor

The model executor will unregister itself after computation is done

The above structure will be implemented for both Quarkus and Springboot environments

Model and lifecycle details
===========================

Currently, there are roughly two kinds of models: stateless (decisions, predictions) and stateful (rules, processes).
The former one may have a simple "evaluate" message invocation, with one single instance of model executor for each actual model, that receives the input data and returns the evaluated results.
For the latter, an additional layer would be needed, i.e. for each model the actual executor is a "tupla" made of the model implementation and the execution context.
So, for each model a model-implementation "listener" is needed and, when it receives a "create instance" message, it instantiate on-the-fly the actual model executor with the context specific for the invocation.

Message serialization
=====================

Very first implementation has been based on Jackson serialization and strongly-typed message classes, but two issues arise:
1) such serialization is hard to manage on complex hierarchies
2) such definitions would be hard to export for different languages/environments

A possible solution could be to

1) use a "_defining_" language (json-schema/protobuffer)
2) define a json structure based only on common attributes; one of them could be "_model-type_" to specify the model the message is directed to
3) let model-specific implementations defines their own specific metadata
4) expose actual "_schema_" (i.e. common + model specific ones) so that client code/developers may retrieve it (as for SOAP)
5) features an automatic class generator for beans mapping the json schema(s), so to avoid time-consuming and error-prone manual work to keep in sync the schema and the mapped beans

Developing
==========

Most of the code should be implemented only once in common abstract classes, and model-specific code should be made of
1) common boiler-plate code
2) model-specific implementation details

To avoid time-wasting and error-prone copy-and-paste procedure, an archetype could be implemented to automatically generate model-specific stub containing the former.
Developers should be expected to only enrich/populate such autogenerated code.

Current status
==============

The design description leads to the following observations, constraints and choices

1) there are roughly three main "concepts": MessageBus, ModelServer, ModelExecutor
2) for each of such concepts there is some shared code and some specific one
3) for MessageBus and ModelServer, the specific code depends on the environment (Quarkus vs Springboot)
4) for ModelExecutor, the specific code depends on the model type

The above naming convention has been used for sake of understanding. Current status (POC WIP) uses different naming, notably

1) ModelServer -> AbstractModelServer

Classes inside `kogito-api-research-integration-tests` sub modules are meant to represent the code-generated ones.

Currently, two examples are provided:

1) app-quarkus-processes
2) app-quarkus-predictions

They will show usage inside Quarkus environment. The former is an example of a "_statefull_" model, while the former represents a "_stateless_" one.



Quick Environment Setup and Start
=================================

1) Download or copy the contents of the [Confluent Platform all-in-one Docker Compose file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/confluentinc/cp-all-in-one/6.1.0-post/cp-all-in-one/docker-compose.yml), for example:

   `curl --silent --output docker-compose.yml \
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/confluentinc/cp-all-in-one/6.1.0-post/cp-all-in-one/docker-compose.yml`

2) Start Confluent Platform (use the -d option to run in detach mode); inside kogito-api-research:

   `docker-compose up zookeeper broker`

3) To verify that the services are up and running, run the following command:

   `docker-compose ps`

4) Start the server; inside kogito-api-research/kogito-api-research-integration-tests/kogito-api-research-integration-tests-server-app-quarkus-(processes/predictions)

   `mvn compile quarkus:dev`

5) Start the client; inside kogito-api-research/kogito-api-research-integration-tests/kogito-api-research-integration-tests-client-app-quarkus-(processes/predictions):

   `mvn compile quarkus:dev`
